# imageclassification_CIFAR10_Data

In this project, we are going to build image classifier using CNN. We will use CIFAR-10 dataset.

This dataset contains 60000 images of 10 different classes, in which 6000 images per class.The dataset is divided into five training batches and one test batch, each with 10000 images. The test batch contains exactly 1000 randomly-selected images from each class. The training batches contain the remaining images in random order, but some training batches may contain more images from one class than another. Between them, the training batches contain exactly 5000 images from each class.
